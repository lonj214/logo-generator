# logo-generator

## Description

I built a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as a SVG file. My motivation fo thi was to give freelance web developers a way to generate a simple logo for their projects so they do not have to pay for a graphic designer. I learned how use inquirer, and how to use testing.

## Usage

Once the user runs node index.js in the terminal they will be prompted with a series of questions. They will be asked what they want their text to say, however it cannot be more than 3 characters long(it will notify them if it is too long). Then they will be asked what color they want the text to be. Then they will be asked what shape they want the logo to be(circle, triangle, or square), they will pick one. The last prompt will be what color they want the shape to be. Once the user completes all the prompts the SVG file is written to generate their logo.
